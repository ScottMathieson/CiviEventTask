# CiviEventTask

Extension Module project for CiviCRM that allows tasks to be defined to manage the set-up and running of an Event. This will allow CiviEvent users to define due dates for pre and post event tasks and report on events which have outstanding tasks. Each task will consist of a name, description, due date (either a fixed date or an offset to the event start date) and a status.
